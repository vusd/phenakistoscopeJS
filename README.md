Installation
=======

  1. Download a built version of PhenakistoscopeJS from: https://github.com/CreativeCodingProjects/phenakistoscopeJS/releases/latest
  2. if you don't already have a text editor get one (I recommend Atom as that is what I use in the videos)
  3. install a development server such as atom-live-server
  4. Watch the tutorial videos at: PLAYLIST URL GOES HERE

Build from source
=======

  1. clone the repo or download the zip
  2. install npm if you don't already have it
  3. npm install
  4. npm run Build

This will build the source and populate the build folder with the necessary libraries.
All the files you need can be found in the build folder, that will form the base folder of your project.
You will need to use a local development server to be able to use all the features in some browsers.
