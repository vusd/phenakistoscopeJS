In the setup_pscope function you will find a few functions that can take
various parameters this file lists the options for each.


pScope.output_mode(....);
    the .... can be replaced with:

    STATIC_FRAME
      STATIC_FRAME is for prototyping your animation by isolating the single wedge.
      it only shows one copy and the bounding box of the wedge. everything is scaled up so you can see it easier.
      This mode DOESNT animate (it is a still frame)

    ANIMATED_FRAME
      ANIMATED_FRAME is for prototyping your animation by isolating the single wedge.
      it only shows one copy and the bounding box of the wedge. everything is scaled up so you can see it easier.
      This mode DOES animate

    STATIC_DISK
      STATIC_DISK outputs the whole phenakistoscope disk.
      This mode DOESNT animate (it is a still frame)

    ANIMATED_DISK
      ANIMATED_DISK outputs the whole animated phenakistoscope disk. This is The
      mode you will likely spend the most time in.
      This mode DOES animate

    OUTPUT_GIF(....)
      OUTPUT_GIF mode will output and download an animated GIF file.
      Replace "...." with the resolution you want ie OUTPUT_GIF(1000) will make a 1000x1000 pixel gif

    OUTPUT_PRINT(print_size)
      OUTPUT_PRINT mode will output a high resolution image that is the correct size for printing.
      This mode requires a second argument that is how big to output.
      print_size can either be:
        A4
        A3


pScope.set_direction(....);
    the .... can be replaced with:

    CW
      when animating rotate the disk clockwise.

      CW
        when animating rotate the disk counterclockwise.


layer.mode(....)  (found in the setup_layers function)
  the .... can be replaced with:

  SWIRL(swirl_density)
    A swirl animation animates your symbol from the center to the edge of the wedge.
    swirl_density is the number of versions of your symbol.

  RING
    A ring animation only has one of your symbol per wedge, this one symbol initially
    will not be animated, you will need to use the animation variables to animate
    your object manually.
